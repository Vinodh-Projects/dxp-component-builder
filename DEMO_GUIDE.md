# AEM Deployment Integration Demo

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

The backend should start on `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # if not already done
npm start
```

The frontend should start on `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Demo the Integration

#### Step 1: Generate a Component
1. Open the frontend in your browser
2. Enter a component description (e.g., "Create a hero banner component with title and CTA button")
3. Click "Generate Component"
4. Wait for the component to be generated and organized

#### Step 2: Test the Build Button
1. In the right panel, click the green "Build" button
2. Watch the notification system show build progress
3. Check the notification for build results

#### Step 3: Test the Deploy Button
1. Ensure AEM Author is running on `http://localhost:4502`
2. Click the blue "Deploy" button in the right panel
3. The deployment modal will open showing:
   - AEM server connectivity status
   - Deployment progress in real-time
   - Build and deployment logs
   - Final deployment results

#### Step 4: Monitor Results
1. Watch the deployment logs in the modal
2. Check the notifications for completion status
3. If successful, click "View in AEM" to open AEM Author
4. Navigate to `/content/dam/mysite/components` to see deployed components

### Component Generation (1 minute)
1. Show the chat interface
2. Enter: "Create a responsive image gallery component with lightbox functionality"
3. Explain the AI processing and component generation
4. Show the generated code in the right panel

### Build Process (30 seconds)
1. Click the "Build" button
2. Show the notification system
3. Explain Maven module building
4. Show build completion notification

### Deployment Process (2 minutes)
1. Click the "Deploy" button
2. Show the deployment modal opening
3. Explain server connectivity check
4. Show real-time deployment progress
5. Point out the logs and status updates
6. Show successful completion
7. Click "View in AEM" if successful

### Error Handling (1 minute)
1. Stop AEM server (if demonstrating errors)
2. Try deployment again
3. Show error handling and notifications
4. Explain troubleshooting features

### Conclusion (30 seconds)
"This integration provides developers with a complete CI/CD-like experience, from component generation to AEM deployment, all within a single interface."

## Troubleshooting During Demo

### If Backend Won't Start
- Check Python version (3.8+)
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check port 8000 is available

### If Frontend Won't Start
- Check Node.js version (14+)
- Run `npm install` first
- Check port 3000 is available

### If AEM Connection Fails
- Ensure AEM Author is running on port 4502
- Check username/password in .env file
- Verify firewall settings

### If Deployment Fails
- Check Maven is installed and in PATH
- Verify project structure exists
- Check AEM server accessibility
- Review backend logs for specific errors

## Demo Environment Setup

### Required Software
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Maven 3.6+
- AEM Author instance (optional for full demo)

### Quick Setup Commands
```bash
# Backend setup
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AEM settings

# Frontend setup
cd frontend
npm install

# Start both services
# Terminal 1:
cd backend && python main.py

# Terminal 2:
cd frontend && npm start
```
