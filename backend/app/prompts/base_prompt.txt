IMPORTANT:
- Provide complete, functional code without truncation
- Include all necessary imports and dependencies
- Use proper AEM naming conventions
- Ensure code is production-ready
- Format response as valid JSON and NO OTHER TEXT
- Do not include explanation text or comments such as 'The above response provides a basic carousel component model with HTL, Sling Model, Dialog and ClientLibs. You'll need to further complete the code and adjust it according to your project's requirements.'
