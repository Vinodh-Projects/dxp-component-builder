Return the closest match or "custom" if no match is found.

{
  "blockName": "string",               // Extracted name of the block and make sure the block name is in lowercase and single word. (e.g., "hero", "accordion").
  "blockStyle": "string",              // Style or variant mentioned (e.g., "dark", "full-width"). Use "default" if not specified.
  "blockType": "string",               // Type of block (e.g., "carousel", "accordion"). Use "custom" if not specified.
  "functionalityDescription": "string" // Concise summary of the block’s functionality.
}

**Example Output (valid JSON):** A JSON object containing:
{
  "blockName": "carousel",
  "blockStyle": "default",
  "functionalityDescription": "It supports autoplay with configurable intervals, navigation arrows for manual slide control, and pagination dots.

- Prefer exact matches from the request.
